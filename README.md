# Installation 
Before running the classifier, make sure you have the relevant .env and dataset files configured separately.
Then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running 
Simply run: 
```
python main.py
```
Note: by default, only the linear layer is trained to avoid long fine-tuning wait times.
